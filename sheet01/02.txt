sky
+ direct solvers with no pivoting
+ if A is spd, skyline structure is preserverd in cholesky decomposition

cds
+ for nonsymmetric diagonally structured matrices (z.b. mehrere diagonalen in der matrix)

ellpack
+ good for efficient computation
- explicit zeros
- not efficient if rows have different # of zero elements
+ little zero padding if rows have the same # of zero elements

jds
+ tailored for sparse matrix vector multiplications
+ suited for simd machines

coo
+ only non-zero elements are stored
+ fast constructing of sparse matrices

csr
+ only non-zero elements are stored
+ fast constructing of sparse matrices
+ conversion to and from coo is possible in linear time

ccs
+ this is essentially the same as csr, just with flipped roles for rows/columns
